					<h2>About me</h2>
					<p>
						I like pretty much anything programming and computer science related and I enjoy learning and trying new things.
						<br/>
						I program in many languages including c and java and have even made a simple interpreter for my own custom language.
						<br/>
						GNU/Linux is my daily driver and I have used a wide of OS's ranging everywhere from mac and windows to
						<br/>
						freedos, templeOS, and even some less common unix like OS's. I have also been on a frc robotics team.
						<br/>
						In that time I had to work with other people who often saw the programming side as almost a form of black magic
						<br/>
						and we had keep clear communication for everything to line up correctly. I enjoyed reading the docs
						<br/>
						for different api's we used along with implementing things similar but better fitted to how are team does it.
						<br/>
						By the end we had in house software for swerve drive and stuff for targeting and auto drive that made heavy use
						<br/>
						of linear algebra. Some over things I have worked on is a bunch of smaller personal projects many of them nearly
						<br/>
						just tech demos along with web assembly games many of them sadly never finished but others finished with pretty
						<br/>
						good end results with chances for fulture updates. As far as mobile dev does I have made a few things in swift
						<br/>
						for iOS though my favorite is a python android app for downloading youtube playlists which I use quite often.

					<h2>Tools and api's I have used</h2>
					<p>
						I always see people focus on learning a language but never really on any tools or api's.
						<br/>
						I believe that learning the tools and api's is one of the most important parts so I 
						<br/>
						made this list.
